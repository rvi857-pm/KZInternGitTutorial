# Welcome to the Git Tutorial for KZ Interns!

### Getting Started
1. **If you have Windows:** [download Git for Windows here](https://gitforwindows.org/), then open Git BASH.
2. **If you have Mac or Linux:** Open Terminal.
3. [Follow this tutorial to generate a public SSH key on your machine with a password.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key)
4. [Add your public SSH key to your new github account using this link.](https://github.com/settings/keys)
5. Run the command `ssh-agent`. If you get back some info about a pid with a number, run the command `ssh-add` and input your password. This will allow you to clone from github without having to input your ssh password every time.
6. **Update your git email and username:**
    `git config --global user.email = '<yourname>@kwanzoo.com'`
	`git config --global user.name = 'Your Name Here'`
7. Clone this repo onto your home machine (in whichever folder you'd like):
	`cd path/to/directory/of/choice`
	`git clone git@github.com:rvi857-pm/KZInternGitTutorial.git`
